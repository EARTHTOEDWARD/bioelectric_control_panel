# Vision: Patient‑Specific Attractor Control for Cancer (Bioelectric Control Panel, BCP)

**North Star.** Build a clinically usable, patient‑specific, closed‑loop platform that measures a tumor’s bioelectric and metabolic dynamics, models them as nonlinear attractor systems, and intervenes (chemo timing/dosing, electroceuticals, gap‑junction modulation, radiotherapy scheduling) to steer the patient from pathological to healthy/benign dynamical regimes. Instead of chasing snapshots (kinetic curves), we act on the geometry and invariant measures of the underlying strange attractors that organize disease.

## Why this approach

Bioelectric + metabolic chaos is real and actionable. Dynamical chaos with Shilnikov‑type strange attractors emerges in tumor–immune–tissue interaction models; the routes to chaos and their organizing codimension‑two bifurcations (degenerate Bogdanov–Takens, zero–Hopf) map out parameter “corridors” where therapy can stabilize tumor‑free or low‑burden equilibria (see Fig. 1 Lyapunov diagram and bifurcation curves; Fig. 2 DBT unfolding; Fig. 3–4 zero–Hopf → torus birth). These give control targets for therapy design.

**Don’t compare “kinetic curves” to strange attractors.** As Grytsay stresses, strange‑attractor modes cannot be faithfully compared to experimental kinetics due to exponential trajectory divergence and hypersensitivity to initial data; instead, use the invariant measure—probabilities of visiting different regions of phase space—as the comparable, stable statistic. We adopt this as a core observable/biomarker.

**Metabolic self‑organization provides levers.** Chaos and quasiperiodicity in cellular metabolism (e.g., NADH loops, respiratory chain coupling, intermittency cascades) establish controllable structures and transitions; these inform where bioelectric/chemo interventions bite.

## End‑to‑End System (what the BCP will be)

### 1) Multi‑scale sensing (patient → panel)
Daily/continuous streams:
- **Bioelectric:** local tissue voltage/impedance (EIT), extracellular potentials, optical voltages when available; autonomic tone (ENG) for systemic coupling; EEG/MEG when CNS involvement matters.
- **Physiology & labs:** pH, lactate, ion panels, CBC, cytokines; imaging‑derived tumor volume/proliferation proxies.
- **Microenvironmental modulators:** gap‑junction status (connexin expression/proxies), hypoxia markers.

All modalities ingest through the BCP pipeline (NWB/OME‑Zarr standardization, QC), already laid out in the current control‑panel architecture.

### 2) Dynamical modeling (panel → dynamical state)

#### 2.1 Phase‑space reconstruction & chaos metrics
- Takens embeddings; delay/embedding selection.
- Largest Lyapunov exponent λ₁, correlation dimension D₂, multiscale entropy, recurrence quantification (RQA).
- Invariant‑measure engine: sliding‑window estimation of μ over Poincaré sections; stability and convergence diagnostics (as per Grytsay’s approach to strange attractors), so we can compare data ↔ model without relying on fragile kinetic curves.

#### 2.2 Bifurcation & attractor atlas
- Tumor–immune–tissue triad lens (Itik–Banks/de Pillis–Radunskaya form): identify operating point relative to DBT/zero–Hopf manifolds; compute distance to homoclinic Shilnikov sets; detect torus/period‑doubling cascades along patient‑specific parameter rays (e.g., effective a₂₁, a₃₁). See the route‑to‑chaos charts and Shilnikov attractor confirmations for design of safe corridors.

#### 2.3 Surrogate models for control
- Echo‑state networks / reservoir computers as compressed forward models that emulate high‑dimensional bioelectric dynamics better than PCA/UMAP alone; used for real‑time control design.

### 3) Control synthesis (dynamical state → actions)

#### 3.1 Objective
Move μ (invariant measure) and attractor geometry from “malignant basin” to “benign/stable basin,” or stabilize tumor‑suppressed equilibria (e.g., P₂ tumor‑free equilibrium) or coexistence equilibria with low tumor burden (O₁/O₂ in the positive octant), as characterized in the bifurcation maps.

#### 3.2 Control channels
- **Chemo & targeted agents:** timing, pulsing, and dose as control inputs to shift effective parameters (e.g., reducing immune inactivation a₃₁, altering competition a₂₁).
- **Electroceuticals:** localized electric fields, vagus/sympathetic neuromodulation to retime/retune bioelectric phase portraits; arrhythmia‑style anti‑spiral nudges for malignant wave patterns.
- **Bioelectric modulators:** agents that tune gap‑junctional coupling or ion‑channel milieu to alter attractor connectivity (category‑level, protocolized—not prescriptive drug advice here).
- **Radiation scheduling:** couple fractionation/boost timing to windows where the attractor traverses high‑vulnerability subfunnels (periodic/torus episodes near zero–Hopf regions).

#### 3.3 Policy types
- **Model‑predictive control on invariant measures (MPC‑μ):** choose next‑day action to maximize Δ toward target μ*.
- **Shilnikov‑aware pulse design:** short perturbations timed to prevent homoclinic returns into malignant funnels (guided by 1‑D Poincaré surrogate maps, as in the attractor‑shape evolution analyses).

### 4) Closed‑loop operation (actions → new data → learning)
- Daily refresh of μ, λ₁, D₂, RQA; adapt policies as the tumor–immune system shifts.
- **Safety rails:** robust tubes around equilibria/torus regions; fallback to conservative regimes if λ₁ spikes or μ drifts toward unstable octants.
- **Human‑in‑the‑loop SACP UI:** interactive attractor visualization, state‑space “weather map,” and slider‑based virtual perturbations with predicted μ‑shifts, as the SACP already prototypes.

## What the clinician sees

- **Patient intake →** Sensors & labs populate the panel.
- **“Signature” card →** chaos/fractal metrics; μ‑map (invariant measure heatmap on the current Poincaré section); attractor class (periodic/torus/chaos/Shilnikov‑positive).
- **Control suggestions →** ranked schedules (“low‑dose daily + E‑field pulses M/W/F”) with predicted Δμ and probability of landing in a blue/stable region (per Fig. 1 blue zones in the cancer model).
- **Drill‑down →** parameter‑plane locator (where the patient sits relative to DBT/ZH curves), with recommended “nudges” to cross into stable regimes.

---

## Key scientific commitments (what we will measure & optimize)

- **Primary observable:** Invariant measure μ on standard sections (and its convergence rate) as a robust, comparable statistic across simulations and patient data.
- **Secondary observables:** λ₁, D₂, H_KS, RQA suite; distance‑to‑homoclinic indicator; torus detectors near zero–Hopf unfoldings; subfunnel counters for Shilnikov attractors (Rössler‑like topology).
- **Control performance:** Δμ toward μ*, time in stable region, tumor‑burden proxies, toxicity constraints.

## Architecture at a glance

- **Data plane:** NWB/OME‑Zarr curation; QC; streaming windows.
- **Analysis plane:** Embedding → chaos/fractal metrics → μ‑estimator → bifurcation locator → surrogate ESN.
- **Control plane:** MPC‑μ, policy library (pulse trains, dose timers), safety shields; scenario simulator to preview μ‑shifts.
- **UI (SACP‑Bioelectric):** real‑time attractor canvas, parameter‑plane map (with overlays for DBT, ZH, HomO₁, period‑doubling cascades per Routes to Chaos figures).
- **Interop:** MAES/Fractal‑LLM hand‑off for hypothesis generation and protocol design.

---

## Clinical translation posture

- **Use:** research/decision‑support; not an automated treatment recommender.
- **Validation:** retrospective datasets → prospective observational → interventional pilots, with IRB and safety boards.
- **Explainability:** attractor‑level explanations (why a schedule shifts μ) replace brittle time‑course curve fitting.

## Roadmap (capability milestones)

- **M1 — μ‑first BCP (now → near‑term):** Implement invariant‑measure pipeline on real bioelectric streams; show μ stability vs. kinetic‑curve instability on the same data (Grytsay criterion). Add Shilnikov/torus detectors; align patient data to the (a₂₁, a₃₁) plane for the cancer triad model; render DBT/ZH overlays in the SACP UI.
- **M2 — Control rehearsal (in‑silico):** MPC‑μ with realistic constraints; show attractor steering in simulations (including period‑doubling and torus corridors). Electroceutical pulse designs that clip homoclinic returns in Shilnikov regimes (1‑D Poincaré guidance).
- **M3 — Human‑in‑the‑loop prototypes:** Daily panel updates; side‑by‑side proposed schedules; clinicians adjust sliders, preview Δμ and stability probabilities.
- **M4 — Early studies:** Feasibility cohorts on one cancer type with strong bioelectric readouts (e.g., accessible solid tumors + EIT). Safety‑first.

## What’s new/differentiated

- Invariant measure as the clinical signal for chaotic biology (not fragile trajectories).
- Bifurcation‑aware control tied to real organizing centers (DBT, ZH, Shilnikov loops) demonstrated in cancer models, giving interpretable levers.
- Electroceuticals + chemo co‑design framed as attractor steering, unified under one control objective.

## Appendix A — Minimal spec for the μ‑estimator (for engineers)

- **Inputs:** windowed state vectors from sensors; Poincaré section definition S(x)=0 with crossing orientation; grid partition over section.
- **Outputs:** empirical μ over cells; convergence diagnostics (1/t decay of variance; KS‑style stability plots), confidence bands (bootstrap over crossings).
- **Guarantees/targets:** invariance to time shift and sample count (beyond burn‑in), robustness to small embedding changes; runtime suitable for daily refresh. (See Grytsay’s demonstrations of μ‑convergence and density evolution across cells with maximum measure.)

## Appendix B — Example “control question” the panel can answer

> “Given today’s μ and location near the AH_O₁ curve, can a 3‑day low‑dose chemo pulse + two 20‑min E‑field sessions move the system left of Het₁ and into the blue (Λ₁<0) zone?”
>
> BCP simulates parameter shifts (↓a₃₁, mild ↓a₂₁) and pulse timing, previews Δμ, flags risk of entering subfunnel sequences, and recommends the safest schedule that keeps distance from Hom_{O₁} while moving toward P₂ stability. (Figures: Routes to Chaos Fig. 1 & Fig. 5 for where those curves live.)

## Closing thought

The BCP reframes cancer care as navigation on a landscape of attractors. With invariant measures as our compass and bifurcation geometry as our map, we can design gentler, smarter, patient‑specific routes out of malignant dynamics.
